# LensSDK

The Zoho Lens Software Development Kit (SDK) for iOS will help you build a custom app with the features and functionalities your customers need to join a session in Zoho Lens to share their camera. The design of the app UI can be based on your requirements and style guidelines, while the back-end of the app can be powered with the SDK.

The software development kit is a fully swiftified project.
